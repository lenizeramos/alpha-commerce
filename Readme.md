# **Final Project - NextCommerce: A Next.js Shopping & Ordering Experience**  

## **Overview**  
Create **NextCommerce**, a modern, authentication-protected platform using **Next.js 15**, **Clerk**, and **Contentful CMS**. Users can browse featured items publicly and access the full catalog upon authentication. This project will test your ability to work with **authentication, CMS integration, and protected routes** while ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user experience.  

ðŸ“Œ **Items can be of your choice** â€“ for example:  
- **E-Commerce Store** showcasing **merchandise, apparel, or tech products**.  
- **Restaurant Website** displaying a **menu with food and drink items**.  

In both cases:  
- **Public visitors see only a subset of items** on the home page.  
- **Authenticated users can view the full catalog and add items to their cart**
- **Content should be managed from Contentful CMS** so that it can be dynamically updated.

## **Submission Guidelines**  
* **Host the app on Vercel & present the live version**.
> If any issue with Vercel not allowing to connect with your repo, you can use the build folder and deploy it in Netlify or other hosting providers.    
* **Submit your URL via this form:** [here](https://forms.gle/tgF2Ukz87o6dC7ko9).  
* **Include a GitHub repo with a clear README (setup instructions required).** Be as technical as you can here. Diagrams are welcomed.

## **Additional Notes**  
- **Presentation** â€“ should start off with demo and then talk about structure and other stuff.  
- **Good design and clean code matter.** Keep it modular and maintainable.  
- Be creative! This is your **final project before the program project**â€”**give it your best!**  
> In your presentation, also show the data workflow on how data comes from CMS and into your app and database.
